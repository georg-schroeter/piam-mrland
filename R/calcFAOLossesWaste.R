#' @title calcFAOLossesWaste
#' @description
#' Calculates the ratio between food supply at household level and food intake for different MAgPIE commodities
#' based on estimated/assumed FAO waste shares for each commodity group (optionally also including food
#' conversion factors into edible matter).
#'
#' @param out_type waste: food-specific ratios based on FAO food waste shares
#' waste_edible:  food-specific ratios based on FAO food waste shares including conversion into edible matter
#' @return List of magpie objects with results on country level, weight on country level, unit and description.
