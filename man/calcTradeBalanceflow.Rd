\usage{
calcTradeBalanceflow()
}
\value{
global domestic balanceflows as MAgPIE object
}
\description{
Calculate the difference between the global production and
             global domestic_supply (corrective balance flow).
             The difference is the result of imports not equaling exports,
             and because storage is not considered. The calculated
             DomesticBalanceflow assures that production matches domestic_supply. The
             goods come from nowhere and go to nowhere. The numbers are usually decreased
             linearly and become zero in 2050.
